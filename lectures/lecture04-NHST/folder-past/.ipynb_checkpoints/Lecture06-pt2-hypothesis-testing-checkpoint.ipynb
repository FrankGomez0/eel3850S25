    "The histogram shows that states with GDPs per capita over the median have higher case counts in general (for instance, the larger bars in the range 2-5), as well as larger maximum values (above 8).  Unfortunately, the data does not provide any insight into why that might be the case. One reason might be that states with higher GDPs may have larger network effects, where more of the population interacts with a larger number of people. For instance, such states may have more of their population employed in office jobs and more likely to travel for their work. "
